	<h3>Purchase</h3>
	<p>For all projects Purchasing is often the most critical aspect of the development: tracking orders, managing vendors, and ensuring that items are delivered in a timely manner so that project time-line is not impacted. We have a decade of experience sourcing both used and new quality components, nationally and internationally. WSI can manage your purchasing while you focus on your project.</p>
