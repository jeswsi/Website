			<h3><strong><a href="http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Simon_Woodruff/">Dr. Simon Woodruff</a>
</strong><span class="text-muted">Physicist</span></h3>
<p>After a decade of research into innovative fusion concepts at the University of Manchester (PhD), Lawrence Livermore National Lab (Postdoc), UC Berkeley Department of Nuclear Engineering (Visiting Scholar), and the University of Washington (Research Scientist), Dr. Woodruff founded WSI to help accelerate the development of economic fusion energy.   Woodruff has performed work under contract to DOE, universities, national labs and to the private sector, building research devices, performing modeling and simulations primarily directed at simply-connected (hence more compact and simpler-to-engineer) fusion systems.  Dr. Woodruff is a member of the American Physical Society and the Institute of Physics.</p>

<h3><strong><a href="http://www.researchgate.net/profile/James_Stuber/">James Stuber</a></strong><span class="text-muted"> Design Engineer</span></h3>
<p>James Stuber graduated with a bachelor&#8217;s degree in Aeronautics and Astronautics from the University of Washington in 2011. Interests in astronautics include orbital mechanics, propulsion, and satellite design. Other interests are computer science and plasma physics. For his senior class capstone James designed hardware and controls for rendezvous with and capture of non-cooperative orbital debris. At Woodruff Scientific James has assisted in the design and construction of lab devices, developed experiment control code, and managed plasma simulations. James is a member of the American Institue of Aeronautics and Astronautics.</p>

<h3><strong>Tom Casper</strong> <span class="text-muted">Physicist</span></h3>
<p>After a career at LLNL, Casper left the Physical
and Life Sciences Directorate after he was selected for a senior
position with the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor
(ITER) in Cadarache, France. As a scientific officer, Casper did
simulations and computations to explore the capabilities of the ITER
device and studied equilibria needed for ITER to meet its performance
specifications. He developed control and plasma scenarios that met the
plasma control and operational requirements. These have implications on
the performance of superconducting magnets, power supplies and the
plasma control system. He integrated R&amp;D and analysis results from
member nations and defining a program of experimental and modeling
activities to further the development of ITER plasma scenarios and
control capabilities.

<h3><strong>Kara A. Olson</strong> <span class="text-muted">Research Assistant</span></h3>
<p>Kara is nearing completion of her
doctorate in Computer Science at Old Dominion University in Norfolk,
Virginia.  Her research interests include analysis of simulation models
in order to enhance understanding.  She has presented her work by
invitation in Germany as well as in England, Canada, the Netherlands,
and nationally.  She was a GAANN Fellow in High Performance Computing &amp;
Communications and holds a Master of Science, Computer Science, Bachelor
of Computer Science and Bachelor of Science, Mathematics from Old
Dominion.  She is a member of ACM, ACM SIGSIM, IEEE/CS, and SIAM.

<h1>Associates</h1>
<p>WSI has a large collaborator base and a Scientific Advisory Board of experts in fusion energy sciences at private and public institutions around the U.S., and abroad.</p>

<h3><strong><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nathaniel_Hicks/">Dr. Nathaniel K. Hicks</a></strong><span class="text-muted"> Physicist, University of Anchorage, Alaska</span></h3>
<p>Dr. Nathaniel Hicks has fourteen years of experience conducting research on innovations in fusion energy science.  In his doctoral work at UCLA, Hicks performed novel experiments on a new type of ion beam with magnetic fusion applications and gained broad competence with experimental plasma, beam, and accelerator physics.  In particular, Hicks has expertise in volume production ion sources, electrostatic beam extraction and transport, and radio frequency quadrupole (RFQ) accelerators.  Hicks also performed the first computational modeling of this type of ion beam in the RFQ and propagation across a transverse magnetic field using particle-in-cell (PIC) codes.</p>

<h3><strong>Chris Raastad</strong><span class="text-muted"> Computational scientist, <a href="http://fits.me">Fits.me</a></span></h3>
<p>Chris graduated with Bachelors in Mathematics and Computer Science from the University of Washington and in the process changed focus from physics, to pure math, to computational physics, to applied math, to finally computer science.  He unexpectedly ended up in Estonia on a Fulbright scholarship to study a Masters in Cybersecurity only to accidentally fall into his true passion of hot tech startups.  Now he spends his days running, singing, and helping make clean code and quality software at Fits.me, a startup using shapeshifting robots to take on the online fitting room world.</p>

<h3><strong><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/James_Garry/">Dr. James R. C. Garry</a></strong> <span class="text-muted"> Physicist, Redcore Consulting, Vancouver B. C.</span></h3>
<p>James is a chartered physicist, and has spent 20 years or so working on applied physics projects of one sort and another. For about 15 years James was a spacecraft engineer, and had involvement with three planetary missions. Now comfortably settled in Vancouver he has switched track and am looking at engineering solutions to energy/resource problems.</p>

<h3><strong><a href="http://me.umbc.edu/dr-carlos-a-romero-talamas/">Dr. Carlos Romero-Talamas</a></strong><span class="text-muted"> Assistant Professor, University of Maryland Baltimore County</span></h3>
<p>Research in Carlos&#8217;s group is focused on understanding basic interactions between materials, charged particles, and electromagnetic radiation. Dusty plasmas, which consist of large collections of electrons, ions, molecules, and charged dust grains, are of great interest to us. Relevance and applications of dusty plasmas range from astrophysics to materials processing. Research is carried out in both theory and experiments.</p>
