<h3><strong>Dr. Tom Casper</strong> <span class="text-muted">Physicist</span></h3>
<p>After a career at LLNL, Casper left the Physical
and Life Sciences Directorate after he was selected for a senior
position with the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor
(ITER) in Cadarache, France. As a scientific officer, Casper did
simulations and computations to explore the capabilities of the ITER
device and studied equilibria needed for ITER to meet its performance
specifications. He developed control and plasma scenarios that met the
plasma control and operational requirements. These have implications on
the performance of superconducting magnets, power supplies and the
plasma control system. He integrated R&amp;D and analysis results from
member nations and defining a program of experimental and modeling
activities to further the development of ITER plasma scenarios and
control capabilities.

<h3><strong>Dr. Roger J. Smith</strong><span class="text-muted"> Physicist, University of Washington
</span></h3>
<p>Dr Roger Smith has over 25 years of experience in diagnostic development
in plasma physics.  From graduate work on field reversed configurations
(FRCs) under Prof. G. Vlases to working at the largest tokamak, the
Joint European Torus (JET), facility,  Dr Smith has originated new and
novel diagnostics: the Transient Internal Probe diagnostic (TIP, 1989),
the JET Divertor Electron Cyclotron Absorption diagnostic (1995) and the
Pulsed Polarimetry diagnostic (2008).  Pulsed polarimetry completes
Lidar Thomson scattering, making possible, for the first time, a
non-perturbative  measurement of internal magnetic field distributions
along the laser sightline for plasmas achieving reactor relevant
parameters.  Dr Smith is currently pursuing spatially resolved field
measurements either by pulsed polarimetry internal to magnetized plasmas
or by means of optical fibers adjacent to the plasma.</p>
